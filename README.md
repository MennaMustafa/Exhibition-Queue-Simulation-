# Exhibition-Queue-Simulation-
Arrivals of people at a telescope exhibit follow an exponential distribution of mean a minutes. 
Only one person can see the exhibit at a time. 
Time taken by one person to see the exhibit follows an exponential distribution of mean s minutes. 
A person can buy a ‘privilege’ ticket for L.E. 30 which gives him/her priority in queue over those who don’t have a privilege ticket. 
50% of the visitors are willing to pay and get a privilege ticket, but they make their decision to do so only if one or more people are 
in queue when they arrive (another person is waiting to be served). 
The exhibit is open continuously from 10 am to 4 pm (last arriving visitor will arrive before 4pm, visitors in the queue will be served 
even after 4pm). Simulate n replications of the operation of the system, each replication has length of one complete day and 
report the following statistics:  
1. Profit gained through sale of privilege tickets 
2. Average waiting time of an exhibit visitor 
3. Average waiting time of an exhibit visitor with a privilege ticket 
4. Average waiting time of an exhibit visitor without a privilege ticket
